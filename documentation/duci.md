# Dataset Usage Cardinality Inference


Did your model train on my data? More importantly, does its use qualify as fair use, or does it infringe on my copyright? As AI continues to advance, this question becomes increasingly critical. According to Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act, determining whether a use constitutes fair use or copyright infringement requires evaluating the "_amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work_" under the "_nature of the copyrighted work_." This raises a key question: **how much of a given dataset was used to train a machine learning model?**

Dataset Usage Cardinality Inference (DUCI) provides an answer. It enables data owners to assess the risk of unauthorized usage and protect their rights by estimating the exact proportion of data used. DUCI achieves this through a debiasing process that aggregates individual Membership Inference Attack (MIA) guesses to deliver accurate results.

## Problem

<img src="images/duci_problem.png" alt="Problem Illustration" title="Simple DUCI Pipeline" width="600">

The Dataset Usage Cardinality Inference (DUCI) algorithm---acting as an agent for the dataset owner with full access to a target dataset---aims to estimate the proportion of the target dataset used in training a victim model, given black-box access to the model and knowledge of the training algorithm (e.g., the population data and model archtecture).

## Method

To estimate the proportion of a target dataset being used, the Dataset Usage Cardinality Inference (DUCI) algorithm first debiases the membership predictions \(\hat{m}_i\) provided by any Membership Inference Attack (MIA) method to obtain the probability of each data record being used, using the following formula:

$\hat{p}_i = \frac{\hat{m}_i - P(\hat{m}_i = 1 \mid m_i = 0)}{P(\hat{m}_i = 1 \mid m_i = 1) - P(\hat{m}_i = 1 \mid m_i = 0)}$,

After debiasing, DUCI aggregates the unbiased probability estimators over the entire dataset to compute the overall proportion:

$\hat{p} = \frac{1}{|X|} \sum_{i=1}^{|X|} \hat{p}_i,$

where $|X|$ is the size of the target dataset.

## Pipeline

In Privacy Meter, DUCI is conducted in the following way:

1. Load the target model and launch the membership inference attack on each record in the target dataset.
2. Launch the same membership inference attack on a reference model (reusing the reference models from MIA if available) to calculate the TPR (\(P(\hat{m} = 1 \mid m = 1)\)) and FPR (\(P(\hat{m} = 1 \mid m = 0)\)) used for debiasing.
3. Debias the predictions using the estimated errors and aggregate them to estimate the overall proportion.

Here is the graphical illustration of the process.

## How to use DUCI in Privacy Meter

To run a DUCI on a target model using 50% of the target dataset, you can use the following command

```

python run_duci.py --cf configs/config_duci.yaml

```

You can load your own `signals` (a matrix of shape `dataset_size Ã— total_num_models`) and `memberships` (with the same shape) for inference. For each run, you can specify which model among the `total_num_models` will be the target model and which models will serve as reference models. You can then launch the DUCI process as shown below:

```python
target_model_indices = [0, 1, 2, 3]
reference_model_indices_all = [[2, 3], [2, 3], [0, 1], [0, 1]]

# Initialize MIA instance
MIA_instance = MIA(logger)
DUCI_instance = DUCI(MIA_instance,logger, args)
duci_preds, true_proportions, errors = DUCI_instance.pred_proportions(
    target_model_indices, 
    reference_model_indices_all, 
    signals,
    memberships,
)
```

In this example, there are 4 runs. The target models for the runs are model 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, with the corresponding reference models for each run as follows:

- **Run 1**: Target model is model 0, and the reference models are 2 and 3.
- **Run 2**: Target model is model 1, and the reference models are 2 and 3.
- **Run 3**: Target model is model 2, and the reference models are 0 and 1.
- **Run 4**: Target model is model 3, and the reference models are 0 and 1.
