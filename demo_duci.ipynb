    "Did your model train on my data? More importantly, does its use qualify as fair use, or does it infringe on my copyright? As AI continues to advance, this question becomes increasingly critical. According to Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act, determining whether a use constitutes fair use or copyright infringement requires evaluating the \"_amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work_\" under the \"_nature of the copyrighted work_.\" This raises a key question: **how much of a given dataset was used to train a machine learning model?**\n",

It enables data owners to assess the risk of unauthorized usage and protect their rights by estimating the exact proportion of data used. DUCI achieves this through a debiasing process that aggregates individual Membership Inference Attack (MIA) guesses to deliver accurate results."
